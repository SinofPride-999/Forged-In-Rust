CLI Bank Management System

    What it must do
        - Create bank accounts with unique IDs
        - Store accounts and balances in memory
        - Allow deposits into an account
        - Allow withdrawals with balance checks
        - Transfer funds between two accounts
        - Reject invalid account IDs
        - Prevent withdrawals or transfers when funds are insufficient
        - Accept and process commands in a loop (create, deposit, withdraw, transfer, balance, exit)
        - Display clear success and error messages for every operation

    Why
        - Practice struct design (Account, Bank, Transaction)
        - Reinforce ownership and borrowing when mutating shared data
        - Use enums for command parsing and transaction types
        - Apply error handling with Result instead of panics
        - Build confidence designing stateful CLI applications
        - Learn to model real-world rules with Rust’s type system

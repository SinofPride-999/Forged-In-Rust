# 🦀 Forged In Rust

**Forged In Rust** is a growing collection of Rust projects built with one goal in mind:  
to continuously sharpen my Rust skills by revisiting the fundamentals and pushing into more advanced territory.

This repository serves as a personal Rust training ground — where concepts are not just learned once, but *forged through repetition, experimentation, and real problem-solving*.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Practice Rust consistently
- Revisit core Rust concepts to stay sharp
- Build intuition around ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, traits, and error handling
- Progress from simple exercises to complex, real-world-style projects
- Strengthen systems-level thinking using Rust

This is not a tutorial repo — it’s a **practice forge**.

## 🧱 Project Structure

Projects are organized by difficulty:

```text
Forged-In-Rust/
│
├── spark/        # Fundamentals, syntax, small focused exercises
├── anvil/        # Core Rust concepts, ownership, traits, error handling
├── steel/        # Advanced Rust, lifetimes, async, systems-level challenges
└── crucible/     # Experiments, ideas, and concept stress-testing
